        <p>The people I want to have come to my website are those that are interested in me. Employers, friends, professors, admirers, anyone who says “Who is this Josh kid, and what is he doing in terms of website building?”</p>	  
        <p>This website is just an example of what I could make for anyone that is interested in my services. I thought of something I loved, and I am able to share it in any way I can think of to anyone I want to share it with.</p>
        <p>Below will be links, each leading to a new adventure as viewed by the characters I created.</p>
