                I, Cazaszar Thein, great illusionist and (con) artist decided to log our missions, possibly a little too late.

                <p>    
                    Yesterday Temper Dross, my loyal wooden warforged friend, and I found ourselves hired by a little girl to hunt "vampires". In our haste to leave we contracted help with a divination wizard, Edward Rainon, and a warlock, Anakis. After a quick hike following the sweet child, we followed a path to the rumored vampires. After a failed attempt to sneak up on the creatures, we ended up dispatching most of the kobolds and releasing the little girl's father and brother. 
                </p>
                <p>   
                    Our reward was a big pile of gold, and a nice warm meal and place to stay. We went to sleep that night with dreams and hopes of our adventures to come. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    That was last night. We woke up in a cell today. Temper says there was a bright light and we were transported here, almost instantly. When we gathered ourselves we noticed an old man in the cell with us. He exuded power and blasted the cell door open. Moments after meeting this old man, a creature came through the door and killed the man with a mysterious weapon. A light began flashing, a loud sound came through the corridors, and we killed the creature to avenge the presumed innocent man. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Many more creatures passed our prison block. I used my illusions to appear to be one of them and went to where they were running from.
                </p> 
                <p>  
                    It turns out, we are in the heavens. Other vessels that seem to be like the one we are on are sailing through the empty space above our home. It left me awestruck. Edward, being the good little scholar he is, began attempting to translate the runes and writing of these creatures. Temper began smashing buttons and pulling levers and might have found out how to activate the loud alarm and bright lights, he is very smart after all.  He might be the smartest in our crew. Obviously the most handsome.
                    After composing ourselves we followed the path of our captors. It led us to a room with buttons. After pressing one of them, we were transported to a room that looked exactly like the one we came from. Going back in the direction of where our cell was, we saw that there were living quarters instead of a prison, and obviously Anakis couldn't let a day go by without using her fireball. I counted 5 or 6 creatures that died without knowing from where. 
                </p>
                <p>   
                    More creatures fled and here we are, trying to decide where to go from here.
