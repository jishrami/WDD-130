            Normally duergar are not playable characters in Dungeons and Dragons, but this campaigns setting was in the underdark. All the companions of Daggar are residents and native to the underdark as well, including teifling and a mindflayer.</p>
        <p>
            The final adventure, as told by Daggar's adventuring companion Revenlay, the teifling rogue.
        </p>
        <p>
            After plunging into darkness, a light appeared, slowly growing closer. As it grew closer and closer, the party realized it was actually the demon commander. Once she was close enough to be intimidating, Daggar asked what their next task was to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            The commander responded, saying that their next task was to take on Daggars own Goddess, Lolth. She agreed to teleport them to the castle of Lolths biggest enemy, Kiaranzelie.
        </p>
        <p>
            As they entered, Daggar just waltzed in saying "I am looking for a new employer", not having no clue of how to live his life, knowing that he must now attack the one who gives him his powers. This alerted the door guard, a snake-like entity wielding 6 scimitars. As Daggar began monologuing about how his life was suddenly worthless, the snake door guard grew tired and struck out, initiating combat. She felled Daggar in one swift move, and Revanlay ran up to heal him. Faylen and Zellix began assaulting from afar, while Xulcof and Big O brought the fight closer to the guard. After a few seconds, the fight drew to a close, with the party coming out on top. Daggar stood up and decided to heal the party back to full health
